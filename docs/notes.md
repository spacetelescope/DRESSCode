# General notes to the user

- Make sure the HEASoft and WCSTools are correctly installed and initialized (see [install guide](install.md)). Without these tools, you wonâ€™t be able to run the pipeline.
- Make sure you are using Python 3.7 or later, and that all required modules are installed properly. The script will emit an error message if a module or package is missing.
- Check the output after each step.
- Questions/problems can be reported through GitHub <a href="https://github.com/spacetelescope/DRESSCode/issues" target="_blank">issues</a>.
